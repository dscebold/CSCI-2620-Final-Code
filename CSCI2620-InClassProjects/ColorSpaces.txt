Think of RGB as a cube.
Think of HSV as a cylinder.

HSV
    Hue:
        Red = 0
        Green = 120
        Blue = 240


HSV vs HSL vs HSB

H & S are always the same (Hue and Saturation)

Value vs Luminance vs Blackness

Luminance has slight difference in how saturation is calculated

Saturation
    Determines the purity of a color
    Pure colors are bright
    Impure colors are closer to grayscale


Value
    is basically a scale white to black


Convert RGB to HSV:

    Range:
        Common are [0, 255], [0, 1], [0, 360]
        We will use [0, 1]

        ** Try to implement [0, 2(pi)] **

        Value = Max(r, g, b)/255

        Saturation = (Max(r, g, b) - Min(r, g, b))/(Max(5, g, b)

        diff = Max - Min

        Saturation = diff/Max

        Hue:
            if red == max
                baseAngle = 0
                baseAngle = baseAngle + 60(g-b)/diff

            if green == max
                baseAngle = 120
                baseAngle = baseAngle + 60(b - r)/diff

            if blue == max
                baseAngle = 240
                baseAngle = baseAngle + 60(r - g)/diff

CMYK:

    Subtractive Color Space

    RGB to CMYK:

        Range [0-1]

        v = Max(r, g, b)

        k = 1 - v

        c = (1 - r - k)/(1 - k)

        m = (1 - g - k)/(1 - k)

        y = (1 - b - k)/(1 - k)

        c = (v - r)/v
        c = 1 - r/v

        m = (v - g)/v
        m = 1 - g/v

        y = (v - b)/v
        y = 1 - b/v



    CMYK To RGB:

        r = v - cv

        g = v - mv

        b = v - yv
